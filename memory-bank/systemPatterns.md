# System Patterns: Freya Backend

## System Architecture

- Modular FastAPI structure: entrypoint (`main.py`) is minimal and only wires together routers, error handlers, and config; all configuration and error handling is in `core/`, all API endpoints are in `api/routes/`. No file should exceed 300-400 lines; everything is organized for maintainability.
- Health (`/health`) and db-health (`/db-health`) endpoints for application and database monitoring.
- Connection pooling for PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy's QueuePool.
- Alembic is used for schema versioning and migrations, with an alembic_version table in the DB to track schema state.
- All schema changes are made via versioned migration scripts, decoupling model changes from app runtime.

- Database initialization script for automated table creation.
- Dedicated endpoint for live database connection testing.
- Stateless REST API using FastAPI (Python).
- PostgreSQL as the primary data store, replacing Firebase.
- Three-tier memory architecture:
  1. User Facts
  2. Recent History
  3. Topic Memory
- Memory context assembly engine injects relevant memory into each API call.
- Event-driven communication with frontend via custom browser events.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Use FastAPI for high performance and async support.
- SQLModel or SQLAlchemy for ORM and migrations (with Alembic).
- Structured logging and validation for all endpoints.
- Full-text search enabled in PostgreSQL for topic retrieval.
- Migration tooling for Firestore â†’ PostgreSQL data transfer.

## Design Patterns

- **Repository Query Pattern**: Dedicated repository for efficient user/topic/fact/message retrieval using SQLAlchemy joins and eager loading. All datetime fields use timezone-aware UTC datetimes for future compatibility.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and memory context assembly are handled in dedicated service classes.
  - `TopicExtractor` service for extracting and scoring topics from messages
  - Future services will handle topic tagging and retrieval
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used for API request/response validation.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Provides consistent fallback behavior.
- **Pattern Matching**:
  - Regex patterns for user fact extraction in `utils/fact_patterns.py` with tests in `tests/test_fact_patterns.py`
  - Keyword-based topic extraction in `app/services/topic_extraction.py` with tests in `tests/test_topic_extraction.py`

## Component Relationships

- **API Layer**: Endpoints in `api/routes/` handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and coordinates between different components
  - `TopicExtractor` processes messages to identify relevant topics
  - Other services handle different aspects of the memory system
- **Data Access Layer**:
  - Repository pattern for database operations
  - SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- **Memory System**:
  - Three-tier architecture (User Facts, Recent History, Topic Memory)
  - Memory context engine aggregates data from all tiers
- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Communicates with backend via browser events and REST endpoints
  - Custom events for real-time updates
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Centralized logging and error handling
  - Configuration management via environment variables
