# Active Context: Freya Backend Rebuild

> Backend setup phase complete—modular FastAPI structure, health and db-health endpoints, PostgreSQL pooling, DB initialization script, and connection testing endpoint all working. Developer experience is smooth and maintainable compared to Node.js. 
- Database schema and all core models fully implemented and tested. 
- Alembic set up for migrations, initial migration script created and applied to PostgreSQL, schema versioning in place. 
- Ready to begin database access layer (repository pattern, CRUD, etc).
> Modular refactor complete; backend code is now split into core/ (config, errors), api/routes/ (endpoints), and main.py (entrypoint only). No file will exceed 300-400 lines. Server and health endpoint work after refactor.

## Current Work Focus

- Planning and documentation for the Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend rebuild.
- Defining system architecture and Optimized memory retrieval queries: Implemented and tested (production-ready).strategies.
- Preparing for Firestore data migration.
- Python version: 3.12.10 (Windows)
- Virtual environment: Created and activated successfully
- Dependencies installed: FastAPI, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, black, isort, flake8
- requirements.txt restored to original stack, all packages installed without build errors
- Project is ready for environment variable configuration (.env.example and python-dotenv)

## Recent Changes

- Project brief and product context documentation established.
- Node.js backend deprecated; frontend is complete and stable.

## Next Steps

1. Document system architecture and design patterns.
2. Specify technology stack and development setup.
3. Draft initial FastAPI backend structure.
4. Plan and document Firestore → PostgreSQL migration process.
5. Set up Railway deployment configuration.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Prioritize stateless API design and robust memory context assembly.
- Ensure compatibility with existing frontend event system.
- Use SQLModel or SQLAlchemy for ORM layer.
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation throughout development.
