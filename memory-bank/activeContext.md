# Active Context: Freya Backend Rebuild

## Current Work Focus

- Planning and documentation for the Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend rebuild.
- Defining system architecture and memory management strategies.
- Preparing for Firestore data migration.
- Python version: 3.12.10 (Windows)
- Virtual environment: Created and activated successfully
- Dependencies installed: FastAPI, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, black, isort, flake8
- requirements.txt restored to original stack, all packages installed without build errors
- Project is ready for environment variable configuration (.env.example and python-dotenv)

## Recent Changes

- Project brief and product context documentation established.
- Node.js backend deprecated; frontend is complete and stable.

## Next Steps

1. Document system architecture and design patterns.
2. Specify technology stack and development setup.
3. Draft initial FastAPI backend structure.
4. Plan and document Firestore â†’ PostgreSQL migration process.
5. Set up Railway deployment configuration.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Prioritize stateless API design and robust memory context assembly.
- Ensure compatibility with existing frontend event system.
- Use SQLModel or SQLAlchemy for ORM layer.
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation throughout development.
