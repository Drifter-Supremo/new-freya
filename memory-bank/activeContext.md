# Active Context: Freya Backend Rebuild

> **Testing Requirements**: All database tests must be run against PostgreSQL (not SQLite). The application uses PostgreSQL-specific features including full-text search (`TSVECTOR`), JSONB fields, and other PostgreSQL-specific optimizations. Test configurations should connect to a PostgreSQL database with the same version as production.

> Backend setup phase completeâ€”modular FastAPI structure, health and db-health endpoints, PostgreSQL pooling, DB initialization script, and connection testing endpoint all working. Developer experience is smooth and maintainable compared to Node.js.
- Database schema and all core models fully implemented and tested.
- Alembic set up for migrations, initial migration script created and applied to PostgreSQL, schema versioning in place.
- Ready to begin database access layer (repository pattern, CRUD, etc).
> Modular refactor complete; backend code is now split into core/ (config, errors), api/routes/ (endpoints), and main.py (entrypoint only). No file will exceed 300-400 lines. Server and health endpoint work after refactor.

## Current Work Focus

- Implementing Phase 4: OpenAI Integration & API Endpoints
- OpenAI service wrapper completed and tested with Freya's fine-tuned model
- Planning for chat completion endpoint and system prompt handling
- Integrating memory context with OpenAI chat completions
- Python version: 3.12.10 (Windows)
- Virtual environment: Created and activated successfully
- Dependencies installed: FastAPI, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, OpenAI, black, isort, flake8
- requirements.txt updated with OpenAI package dependency
- Project is configured with environment variables (.env file contains OPENAI_API_KEY and POSTGRES_URL)

## Next Steps

1. Create the chat completion endpoint
2. Implement system prompt handling
3. Add conversation management endpoints
4. Implement frontend integration with the browser event system
5. Complete data migration from Firestore to PostgreSQL

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Prioritize stateless API design and robust memory context assembly.
- Ensure compatibility with existing frontend event system.
- Use SQLModel or SQLAlchemy for ORM layer.
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation throughout development.
- Implement API endpoints first for conversation management, then for chat completions
- Build browser event emitter to maintain compatibility with existing frontend
