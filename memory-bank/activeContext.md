- Defining system architecture and memory management strategies.
- Preparing for Firestore data migration.

## Recent Changes

- Project brief and product context documentation established.
- Node.js backend deprecated; frontend is complete and stable.

## Next Steps

1. Document system architecture and design patterns.
2. Specify technology stack and development setup.
3. Draft initial FastAPI backend structure.
4. Plan and document Firestore â†’ PostgreSQL migration process.
5. Set up Railway deployment configuration.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
