# Progress: Freya Backend Rebuild

## What Works

- **Backend setup phase complete:** Modular FastAPI structure, health and db-health endpoints, PostgreSQL connection pooling, database initialization script, and connection testing endpoint are all working. Developer experience has been smooth and maintainable compared to Node.js.
- Modular refactor complete: `app/main.py` is now minimal and only wires together routers, error handlers, and config; all logic is split into `app/core` and `app/api/routes`. Server and health endpoint work after the refactor.
- FastAPI backend app is running locally with environment variable loading and logging configuration complete.
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) is working and logs requests.
- Frontend is complete and fully functional.
- GPT-4.1 Mini fine-tuned model is ready for integration.
- Project documentation and planning are underway.
- Python 3.12 environment is set up.
- Virtualenv is working.
- All dependencies installed with no build errors.
- Requirements.txt restored to the original stack.

## What's Left to Build

- Full FastAPI backend implementation.
- PostgreSQL schema and memory architecture.
- Memory context assembly engine.
- API endpoints for chat, memory, and topic search.
- Firestore to PostgreSQL migration tooling.
- Structured logging and error handling.
- CI/CD pipeline setup for backend.
- Railway deployment configuration.

## Current Status

- Backend rebuild is in the planning/documentation phase.
- Node.js backend is deprecated and not in use.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues at this stage; backend development pending.
