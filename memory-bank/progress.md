## Security Improvements

- Removed hardcoded fine-tuned model ID from js/apiLogic.js and replaced with [REDACTED_MODEL_ID]

- Verified no actual secrets in script.js.backup, summarizerLogic.js, and firebaseLogic.js (only placeholders or logic)

## Known Issues

- No critical issues at this stage; backend development is on track.
