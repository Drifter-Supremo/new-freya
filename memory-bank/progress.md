   - Improve memory context building
   - Enhance response times
   - Implement caching where appropriate

2. Deployment Preparation (Phase 7)
   - Set up hosting environment
   - Configure production environment variables
   - Implement secure key management
   - Create deployment documentation

## Known Issues and Resolutions

1. **Virtual Environment Activation (macOS)**
   - Use `source venv/bin/activate` instead of Windows-style activation
   - Python 3.11+ required

2. **Import Errors**
   - Fixed by ensuring proper module structure
   - Added __init__.py files where needed
   - Updated import paths to use app.* prefix

3. **Database Schema Issues**
   - Resolved by adding missing columns via migrations
   - Fixed field name mismatches (username vs name)
   - Added proper relationship definitions

4. **Empty Message Validation**
   - Fixed by adding min_length=1 validation to message field
   - Now properly rejects empty messages with 422 status

5. **SSE Endpoints**
   - Not used by current Firebase implementation
   - Frontend uses simpler /firebase/chat endpoint
   - SSE endpoints remain for future streaming needs
