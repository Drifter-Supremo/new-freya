# Progress: Freya Backend Rebuild

## What Works

- **Backend setup phase complete:** Modular FastAPI structure, health and db-health endpoints, PostgreSQL connection pooling, database initialization script, and connection testing endpoint are all working. Developer experience has been smooth and maintainable compared to Node.js.
- Modular refactor complete: `app/main.py` is now minimal and only wires together routers, error handlers, and config; all logic is split into `app/core` and `app/api/routes`. Server and health endpoint work after the refactor.
- FastAPI backend app is running locally with environment variable loading and logging configuration complete.
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) is working and logs requests.
- Frontend is complete and fully functional.
- GPT-4.1 Mini fine-tuned model is ready for integration.
- Project documentation and planning are underway.
- Python 3.12 environment is set up.
- Virtualenv is working.
- All dependencies installed with no build errors.
- Requirements.txt restored to the original stack.
- [x] Implement optimized queries for memory retrieval
  - Implemented a dedicated repository for optimized memory queries (user, topic, facts, recent messages) with SQLAlchemy, including production and test coverage.
- [x] Implement and test full-text search functionality
  - Successfully implemented PostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector/tsquery
  - Created and tested the `search_topics_by_message_content` method in MemoryQueryRepository
  - Fixed compatibility issues with PostgreSQL function syntax
  - Verified relevance scoring works correctly with different search terms
- [x] Implement relevance scoring for fact retrieval
  - Added `get_facts_with_relevance` method to MemoryQueryRepository
  - Implemented scoring based on fact type weight, text similarity, and term matching
  - Created a new endpoint `/user-facts/{user_id}/relevant` for accessing facts with relevance scores
  - Added memory context assembly service for integrating relevant facts into chat context
  - Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/test_fact_relevance.py` and `tests/test_memory_context.py`
- [x] Implement conversation history service (Tier 2: Recent History)
  - Created `ConversationHistoryService` for managing conversation history and context
  - Implemented methods for retrieving recent conversations, conversation history, and messages across conversations
  - Added conversation context management functionality
  - Created API endpoints for retrieving conversation history and context
  - Added comprehensive test coverage in `tests/test_conversation_service_basic.py` and `tests/test_conversation_api_basic.py`
  - Integrated with memory context service for improved context assembly

## Phase 2: Database Schema & Models â€” Complete

- **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) created** and saved to `memory-bank/erd.md`
- **Table relationships and constraints fully defined** in `memory-bank/relationships.md`
- **Database query optimization strategies documented** in `memory-bank/db_optimization.md`
- **All core models implemented and tested:**
    - User
    - Conversation
    - Message
    - UserFact
    - Topic
    - MessageTopic (join table)
- **Bidirectional relationships and many-to-many associations tested and working**
- **Unit tests for each model** confirm correct schema and ORM integrity
- **Alembic set up for migrations**
- **Initial migration script created and applied to PostgreSQL**
- **Schema versioning in place (alembic_version table)**

## What's Left to Build

- [x] Memory context assembly engine (implemented in `memory_context_service.py`)
- [x] Port regex patterns from legacy code (patterns ported and tested via `utils/fact_patterns.py` and `tests/test_fact_patterns.py`)
- [x] Implement and test user fact storage logic (facts extracted from messages and persisted to DB; duplicate handling verified)
- [x] Implement conversation history service (created in `conversation_history_service.py` with API endpoints)
- API endpoints for chat and topic search
- Firestore to PostgreSQL migration tooling
- Structured logging and error handling
- CI/CD pipeline setup for backend
- Railway deployment configuration

## Current Status

- Backend rebuild is in the implementation phase, with database schema, models, and memory system (Tier 1 and Tier 2) complete.
- User Facts (Tier 1) and Recent History (Tier 2) memory systems are fully implemented and tested.
- Memory context assembly service is working and integrated with conversation history.
- Node.js backend is deprecated and not in use.

## Security Improvements

- Removed hardcoded fine-tuned model ID from js/apiLogic.js and replaced with [REDACTED_MODEL_ID]
- Removed hardcoded Firebase configuration (API key, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, appId, measurementId) from js/firebaseEnv.js and replaced with [REDACTED_*] placeholders
- Verified no actual secrets in script.js.backup, summarizerLogic.js, and firebaseLogic.js (only placeholders or logic)
## Known Issues

- No critical issues at this stage; backend development is on track.
